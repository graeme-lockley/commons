# commons

I am fan of Apache Commons and I like the approach that they have used in creating a wonderful set of utility functions
for the standard types. This project uses a similar approach in sweeping together the utility functions that I use in
my day-to-day work.

The intent is to fold this code into Apache Commons or something similar at some point.

More recently I have started to add Java 8 like features for those projects that I am working on that are
using Java 6 or Java 7.  This is useful in that I am able to make use of Java 8 idioms particularly with the use of Optional
and Streams.
