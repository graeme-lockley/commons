# commons

I am a fan of Apache Commons and I like the approach that they have used in creating a wonderful set of utility functions for the standard types. This project uses a similar approach in sweeping together the utility functions that I use in my day-to-day work.

The intent is to fold this code into Apache Commons or something similar as and when I find an opportunity to do so.

More recently I have started to add Java 8 like features for those projects that I am working on that are
using Java 6 or Java 7.  This is useful in that I am able to make use of Java 8 idioms particularly with the use of Optional and Streams.  The package names of the classes will be different and the interface and class signatures will be different but it remains useful in nudging the code base and preparing the code base for a (relatively) simple upgrade.
